This is the first proper assignment introduced in The Odin Project, the self-study course that I am currently following. 

Having always been slightly interested in Web Design after studying it for a bit in high school and going to university for Graphic Design, I believe this first task is going to be really easy and fun to do.

This is my first time ever using Git and GitHub, so I am also trying to learn how to structure my commits, how often to make them etc.
